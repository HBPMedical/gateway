The Medical Informatics Platform
================================

### About

The Medical Informatics Platform (MIP) is the most advanced, fully operational, open source platform for sharing of decentralized clinical data.

Clinical data that cannot be shared, transferred and stored in a centralized way can be federated and collaboratively analysed.

Data Owners have full control of accessibility and sharing of their data through a tightly controlled accreditation, access control and user management system.

Documentation about the project can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/hbpmedical/mip-docs).

For more detailed information: [EBRAINS website](https://ebrains.eu/service/medical-informatics-platform/).
