# Visualisations

To see the different possible visualisations in the frontend we have integrated [storybook.js](https://storybook.js.org) directly in the frontend.

Start the storybook by launching this command in the frontend folder

```bash
yarn storybook
```

This command will give you access to the a website with all the visualisation that are currently implemented.
