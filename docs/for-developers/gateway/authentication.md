# ðŸ”‘ Authentication

The authentication implementation is based on [passport.js](https://www.passportjs.org) it allows a flexible way to implement different strategies inside the gateway.&#x20;

For now the authentication system is quite simple and only use JWT. The real implementation of  authorization and authentication is left to the connector/engine.&#x20;

#### How it works ?

The communication between the frontend and the gateway is handled by JWT token who contains user information such as his username.

The gateway will handle the authentication process with the frontend in a unique fashion always using a JWT token. This token can contains information specific to some connector. For that purpose the user model contains a field `extraFields` which basically a dictionary.&#x20;

{% code title="user.model.ts" %}
```typescript
import { Field, ObjectType } from '@nestjs/graphql';
import { Entity, PrimaryColumn, Column } from 'typeorm';

@Entity({ name: 'user' })
@ObjectType()
export class User {
  @PrimaryColumn()
  @Field()
  id: string;

  @Field()
  username: string;

  @Field({ nullable: true })
  fullname?: string;

  @Field({ nullable: true })
  email?: string;

  @Column({ nullable: true, default: false })
  @Field({ nullable: true })
  agreeNDA?: boolean;

  extraFields?: Record<string, any>;
}
```
{% endcode %}

This field can be used by the connector to store information related to the user as other token for engine API endpoints.

#### Login&#x20;

The real login system is delegated to the connector by using the `login` method in the interface.

{% code title="connector.interface.ts" %}
```typescript
export interface Connector {
  // ...
  
  /**
   * Method that login a user with username and password
   * @param username
   * @param password
   * @returns User object or empty if user not found
   */
  login?(
    username: string,
    password: string,
  ): Promise<User | undefined>;

  // ...
}
```
{% endcode %}

This method can be optional as the authentication can be made by a 3rd party system under the same domain as this is the case for `exareme`.

When the login is performed, this function should return a `User` object and can feed the `extraFields` attribute with data needed to perform future request to the engine.

#### Logout

The same mechanism is applied to the logout system using the method logout from the engine.

{% code title="connector.interface.ts" %}
```typescript
export interface Connector {
  // ...
  
  logout?(req: Request
  ): Promise<void>;

  // ...
}
```
{% endcode %}

#### Session validation

Whenever a Frontend required a refreshToken, the gateway should tell if the user is still connected to the engine. For this, your connector should implements the function **isSessionValid**.&#x20;

{% code title="connector.interface.ts" %}
```typescript
export interface Connector {
  // ...
  
  isSessionValid?(user: User): Promise<boolean>;

  // ...
}
```
{% endcode %}

This function should ensure that the user can still access the engine with the current token.

#### How to get the user&#x20;

Whether you use the local login or a 3rd party system, there is a unique way to access the user inside the Gateway. This method through the request :&#x20;

```typescript
request.user
```

This request's attribute is feed by strategy policies defined in the Gateway. Currently the following strategies are applied&#x20;

1. JWT cookies
2. JWT bearer
3. Engine (use the connector to retrieve the user)

Even if the `AUTH_SKIP` is defined you should be able to retrieve the user through the request.
